Overview
========

Bitcoin WebUI is a JavaScript web interface for bitcoind, allowing to access
most of bitcoind's RPC functions through an easy to use web interface if you
don't want to run bitcoin-qt locally or just prefer a web interface.


System Requirements
===================

Bitcoin WebUI requires Python >= 2.6, most testing is done with Python 3.2.
The required Python modules should usually be installed by default.
Bitcoin WebUI uses bitcoind as a backend via its RPC interface.


Getting started
===============

1. Copy config.py.example to config.py
2. Adjust configuration settings as neccessary
3. Generate SSL certificate for the web server:
   openssl req -new -newkey rsa:1024 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -keyout server.pem -out server.cert
4. Run python webui.py
5. Connect to https://localhost:8338 with your favorite web browser
